# Sistema Contable Pro - Replit.md

## Overview

Sistema Contable Pro is a full-stack accounting SaaS application designed for the Ecuadorian market. It's built with a client-server architecture using React/TypeScript on the frontend and Express.js on the backend, with PostgreSQL as the database and Drizzle ORM for database operations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Context API for auth and company state
- **UI Framework**: ShadCN UI components with Tailwind CSS
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack React Query for server state management

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon Database serverless driver
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Session Management**: Simple in-memory session store with JWT-like tokens
- **API Design**: RESTful API with structured error handling

### Database Schema
The application uses a relational database structure with the following entities:
- **Users**: Authentication and user management
- **Companies**: Multi-tenant company support
- **Clients**: Customer management per company
- **Invoices**: Invoice tracking with status management

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- JWT-like token-based authentication using session storage
- Secure token storage in localStorage with automatic header injection
- AuthGuard component for route protection
- AuthContext for global authentication state management

### Multi-Company Architecture
- Company-scoped data access ensuring tenant isolation
- CompanyContext for managing selected company state
- Company switcher UI component for easy switching between companies
- All business operations are scoped to the selected company

### Data Management
- Type-safe API client with centralized error handling
- React Query for caching, background updates, and optimistic updates
- Form validation using Zod schemas shared between client and server
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### UI/UX Design
- Modern dashboard layout with fixed sidebar navigation
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS utilities
- Professional component library based on ShadCN UI
- Loading states and skeleton components for better UX

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: User logs in → Server validates credentials → Returns session token → Client stores token → All subsequent requests include token
2. **Company Selection**: User selects company → Company ID stored in localStorage → All API calls scoped to selected company
3. **Data Operations**: User performs CRUD operations → React Query handles caching and updates → UI reflects changes optimistically
4. **Form Submissions**: Form validates with Zod → Data sent to API → Success/error feedback via toasts → Query cache invalidated

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Neon Database driver for PostgreSQL
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Headless UI components for accessibility
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management
- **zod**: Runtime type validation and schema validation

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Vite development server with HMR for frontend
- tsx for running TypeScript backend in development
- Environment variables for database configuration

### Production Build
- Vite builds optimized frontend bundle to `dist/public`
- esbuild bundles backend to `dist/index.js`
- Single deployment artifact with both frontend and backend

### Database
- Drizzle migrations stored in `/migrations` directory
- Database schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- Connection via environment variable `DATABASE_URL`
